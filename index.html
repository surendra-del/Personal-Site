          <h3>Web Developer</h3>
          <p>I'm new to it. But I think I almost cracked it. And I also think i might design a great web page which has more UX and UI design in it. I like to
           keep my designs simple and focus more on topography and colour theory.</p>

          <h3>A Good Reader.</h3>
          <p>I read about 150 novels so far, I think I'm pretty good at it. I have have completed the famous harry potter novels which almost
           all have done in their child hood, and I find Christopher C Doyle novel series on mahabharatha to be very intresting.</p>
